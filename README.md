project 7

There will be two files, and the images in a word doc, have your images in two folders(put the one with training images
 in the first path labeled "Training" with the path link to the folder
 and the other with the test images in the second path labeled "Test" with the path link to the folder)
 the files are: a "label dector.py" file which has the class for the labels and a "4240project7newnew.py" which will be doing the training phase
 and the operation phase of the project.
 
How to run program: Use python and use python console to run the "4240project7newnew.py". to change to python console, go to the name of the
file in the top right after running the code and click the drop down arrow and click "run with python console"
then click run for "4240project7newnew". it should run and display the training image that atches the test image which 
will appear next to it. it will also print the chord length in the python console as well as will print unknown
when it detects a shape that says "STOP" in the python console so look there.
